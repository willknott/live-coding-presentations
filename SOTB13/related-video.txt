Last year at the State of the Browser conference in London, in an arbitrary but fun test, I pitted the browsers against each other to see which could render the most 3D particles. 
This year, to change it up a bit, I live coded a space invaders type game, complete with particle explosions, and invited the browser reps to compete in a short tournament.

The code was from the new CreativeJS games workshop, so itâ€™s pretty simple to understand. You can get the source code on my github, and watch the video for a full (if slightly rushed) explanation.
